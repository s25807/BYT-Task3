## Initial Setup

1. In terminal, use the following command to install the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/s25807/BYT-Task3.git
```

2. Open the `Tut_s25807.sln` solution file with an IDE such as Rider or Visual Studio - it will ease setup time for all projects.

## Task 1

- this project contains the `Tutorial_Shapes_Project_Code.cs` file that was given along with the task
- project `Tut_s25807.Tests` contains the file `Tutorial_Shapes_Project_CodeForTests.cs` which has tests implemented for all shapes
- all it should take to run the tests is click the appropriate file and click something along the lines of, __"Run JUnit Tests"__

## Task 2

- `Tut_Calc_s25807` contains __"Program.cs"__ and __"Calculator.cs"__
- `Calculator.cs` has class implementation while `Program.cs` contains examples of usages
- `Tut_Calc_s25807.Tests` contains the `Calculator_Tests.cs` file that has tests implemented for all possible scenarios
